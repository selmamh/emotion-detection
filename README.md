Human emotion detection and support recommendation
In the recent years, many studies have been held on detecting human emotions from texts. Aiming to advance the human-computer interaction, computational detection is adopted in measuring the emotions expressed in human written texts. These text analysis have a limitation focusing only on polarity detection which can detect if the text has a negative aspect or positive. This approach did not help in figuring out the real human empathy behind, such as happiness, sadness, fear, anger, disgust etc. In this project, we worked on building a prediction model which can classify a text based on the degree of empathy expressed. This study aims to build a computational work distinguishing between multiple
forms of empathy, empathic concern, and personal distress, as recognized throughout psychology.
